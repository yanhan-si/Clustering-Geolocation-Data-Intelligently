# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently
In this project, we will take raw geographical data, and cluster it effectively using basic or more advanced density-based clustering techniques

## Project Structure
This project on Clustering Geolocation Data is divided into following tasks:

* Task 1: An introduction to the problem, as well as basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations
* Task 2: Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way
* Task 3: Methods of evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm
* Task 4: Theory behind K-Means, and how to use it for our problem
* Task 5: Introduction to density-based clustering approaches, and how to use DBSCAN
* Task 6: Introduction to HDBSCAN, to alleviate constraints of classical DBSCAN
* Task 7: A simple method to address outliers classified by density-based models
